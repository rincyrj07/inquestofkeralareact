Kerala is one of the small states of India in terms of area. it consists of only 1.3 per cent of the total area of India. The state is located in the southwest corner of India. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu bound it on north, east and south and on east by the Arabian Sea. Physiographically, the state may be divided into three regions, Highlands, Midlands and Lowlands. In between the high western ghats and the Arabian sea, the width of the State varies from 35 km to 120 km. There are extensive backwaters, lagoons, and coconut trees in the lowland area. The midland area are watered by numerous streams and where the presence of rice-fields, arecanut and coconut trees continues to dominate the landscape. The third natural part, the highlands of western ghats consists deep ravines and thick jungles. Thus Kerala is a narrow stretch of green land. The state is a land of rivers and backwaters. As many as 41 rivers which rise from the western ghats, flow down to the midlands and lowlands to the west. There are a few east flowing rivers also, which are the tributaries of the Cauvery. The length of most of the rivers is extremely limited and they are monsoon-fed. Some of the rivers are Bharatapuzha, Chalakkudy, Peechi, Malampuzha, Gayatri, Walayar, Vazhani, Neyyar, Periyar, Mangalam and Cheerakuzhy.The backwaters form a specially attractive and economically valuable feature of Kerala. They include lakes and ocean inlets which stretch irregularly along the coast. The biggest backwater is the Veembandh lake. The state has a long coastline is about 550 km long. The state enjoys an equable climate with high temperatures almost throughout the year. There is participation of both monsoon southwest and northeast. The highland area receives more rainfall than other parts of the state.

        Kerala, which lies in the tropic region, is mostly subject to the type of humid tropical wet climate experienced by most of Earth's rainforests. As per Köppen climate classification, it belongs to the category of Tropical monsoon climate[4] Meanwhile, its extreme eastern fringes experience a drier tropical wet and dry climate. Kerala receives an average annual rainfall of 3107 mm – some 7,030 crore m3 of water. This compares to the all-India average is 1,197 mm. Parts of Kerala's lowlands may average only 1250 mm annually while the cool mountainous eastern highlands of Idukki district – comprising Kerala's wettest region – receive in excess of 5,000 mm of orographic precipitation (4,200 crore of which are available for human use) annually. Kerala's rains are mostly the result of seasonal monsoons. As a result, Kerala averages some 120–140 rainy days per year. In summer, most of Kerala is prone to gale-force winds, storm surges, and torrential downpours accompanying dangerous cyclones coming in off the Indian Ocean. Kerala's average maximum daily temperature is around 37 °C; the minimum is 19.8 °C.

The moisture-laden winds of the Southwest Monsoon, on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, because of its topography, divides into two branches; the "Arabian Sea Branch" and the "Bay of Bengal Branch". The "Arabian Sea Branch" of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats, making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon.

        <Accordion.Body>
        The highlands of Kerala experience several types of landslides, of which debris flows are the most common. They are called 'Urul Pottal' in the local vernacular. The characteristic pattern of this phenomenon is the swift and sudden downslope movement of highly water saturated overburden containing a varied assemblage of debris material ranging in size from soil particles to boulders, destroying and carrying with it every thing that is lying in its path

        <Accordion.Header>Flooding</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        Although the Kerala state does not experience floods as severe as in the Indo-Gangetic plains, incidence of floods in the State is becoming more frequent and severe. The latest among them was the 2020 Kerala floods. The continuous occurrence of high intensity rainfall for a few days is the primary factor contributing to the extreme floods in the State. Other factors include wrong land use practices and mismanagement of the water resources and forests.

        <Accordion.Header>Lightning</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        Kerala is a place of high lightning incidence compared to most of the other parts in India because of its weather patterns and the location of the Western Ghats. Higher population density and vegetation density result in more casualties. Lack of awareness also aggravates the situation. Accidents caused by ground conduction from trees, which is a special feature of Kerala, add to the casualties and loss of property. The records show that the months April, May, October and November have the highest lightning rates. The most active time of the day is from 15:00 to 19:00. Of the fourteen districts, five have much higher rates than others

        <Accordion.Header>Drough</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        Kerala has been experiencing increasing incidents of drought in the recent past due to the weather anomalies and developmental pressures resulting from the changes in land use, traditional practices, and life style of the people. The increase in population and subsequent expansion in irrigated agriculture, and industrial growth necessitated the exploitation of more water resources. The changes in the land and water management practices affected the fresh water availability during summer months. Although the deviation in the annual rainfall received in Kerala, in any year from the long term average is very small, there is considerable variation in the rainfall availability during the different seasons. About 95 percent of annual rainfall is confined to a six-month monsoon period between June and November, leaving the remaining six months as practically dry.
